/* Strings: The first sentence of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
 is below. Store this sentence in a string, and then prompt the 
 user for a string to search for within this string. 
 Print whether or not the search term was found. See if 
 you can make the search case-insensitive, so that searching 
 for "alice" prints true.

/* Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister

pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' 
thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?' */
